- This project aims to provide a simple tool for users to allocate their portfolio amount evenly across a selection of S&P 500 stocks. 
- It takes data from the IEX Cloud API to retrieve up-to-date stock information
- Python is used for data manipulation and analysis
- I have done mathematical calculations to distribute the portfolio amount equally among chosen stocks
